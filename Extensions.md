## New ones to look at

1. `Import Cost`: display inline in the editor the size of the imported package
1. GitLens - maybe, https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens
1. `ESLint`: uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running `npm install eslint` in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install. On new folders you might also need to create a `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command `Create ESLint configuration` or by running the `eslint` command in a terminal
1. `Code Spell Checker`: to help catch common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low
1. Better Comments: The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code (Alerts, Queries, TODOs, Highlights, and more)
1. Peacock: Subtly change the color of your Visual Studio Code workspace
1. CSS Peek: don't think so
1. Git Graph: don't think so
1. MarkDown All in One: don't think so
1. Thunder Client: Lightweight Rest API Client to test API
1. `PolaCode`: polaroid for your code

```js
/**
 * Add 2 numbers together
 * @param {number} x The first number to add
 * @param {number} y The second number to add
 * @returns number
 */
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

add(2, 2);
```
